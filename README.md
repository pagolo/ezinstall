ezinstall
=========

A cgi script for easy php applications installation.
---------

Think of a web application for a LAMP server: as usual, it has an installation routine, but
you often have to do many jobs by hand, such as downloading archive, uncompressing it,
uploading it via ftp, searchimg for configuration file to be modified by hand and getting
bored to set up cryptic unix file permissions.
Ezinstall aims to do it all for you with no effort.
The only thing you need is a small xml file tailored on the archive you want to install and,
naturally, ezinstall installed as a suexec cgi script.
The script is not out of development status, it needs some work to be considered finished.
For a detailed description see DONE & TO DO doc file.
