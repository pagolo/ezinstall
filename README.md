ezinstall
=========

A cgi script for easy php applications installation.
=========

Think a LAMP application: as usual, it has an installation routine, but you often have to do
Many jobs by hand, such as download archive, uncompress it, upload it via ftp and get bored
Setting up cryptic unix file permissions.
Ezinstall aims to do it all for you with no effort.
The only thing you need is a small xml file tailored on the archive you want to install and,
Naturally, ezinstall installed as a suexec cgi script.
The script is not out of development status, it need some work to be con sidered finished.
